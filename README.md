Internship Task: Bank Marketing Decision Tree Classifier

üöÄ Project OverviewThis project was completed as part of an internship task to demonstrate skills in data analysis and machine learning. The goal was to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank's product or service.The project uses the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a classic dataset in the field of predictive modeling.
‚ú® Key FeaturesData Preprocessing: Handles categorical data using one-hot encoding.Model Training: Builds a DecisionTreeClassifier using the scikit-learn library.Model Evaluation: Calculates and reports the model's accuracy.Visualization: Generates and displays a confusion matrix and a visual representation of the decision tree.üõ†Ô∏è Technologies UsedPython: The core programming language for the project.pandas: Used for data loading and manipulation.scikit-learn: The primary library for creating and training the machine learning model.matplotlib & seaborn: Used for data visualization, including the decision tree and confusion matrix plots.
üìÅ Setup and InstallationFollow these simple steps to get the project running on your local machine.PrerequisitesYou must have Python installed. If you don't, you can download it from python.org.1. Install LibrariesOpen your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install all the necessary Python libraries:pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
2. Download the DatasetThe project requires the bank-additional-full.csv file. You can download it directly from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.3. Place Files in the Same FolderMake sure the downloaded CSV file (bank-additional-full.csv) and the Python script are in the same directory.
üèÉ How to Run the ScriptOnce you have everything set up, you can run the script from your terminal:python your_script_name.py
Replace your_script_name.py with the name you saved your script as (e.g., decision_tree_task.py). The script will then:Print the preprocessing steps to the console.Display the model's accuracy and confusion matrix.Open a new window showing the visual representation of the decision tree.
üìä Results and ConclusionThe model was able to predict customer subscription with an accuracy of [Insert your calculated accuracy here]. The visualizations provide valuable insights into the key features that influenced the model's decisions, such as the duration of the last contact and the euribor3m interest rate.This project successfully demonstrates the application of a decision tree classifier to a real-world business problem, providing a solid foundation for more complex predictive analytics tasks.
